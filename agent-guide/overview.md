# Overview

An agent must know how to use all platform functionalities and tools to have the best way to manage the contacts with their customers using different channels. Vivocha allows communication through different media: **Chat**, for quick interactions; **VOIP call**, to talk directly via the browser; **CallBack**, for customers that want to be contacted on their phone; **VideoChat**, for face-to-face communication; and **WebLead**, for 24/7 email availability.

Moreover Vivocha comes with a lot of useful functionalities, for example the chat is packed with advanced features like customer navigation path, co-browsing, form sharing, canned responses, automatic translation, and high integrability with other tools and platforms.

We'll guide you into an overview of each of these features.
