## Customer info

In this area there are the **main informations about the customer** you are managing, which allow the agent to provide the best support possible.

During the first contact with the customer, some of this information will be readily available \(customer geolocation, browser and OS he is using, page from which he started the contact and dates about his current session\).

The remaining informations \(First name, Last name, e-mail and Phone number\) will be available, in whole or in part, if the customer is logged in, or will be collected bt the agent during the contact.

By clicking on the center of **Notes** box, the agent can add some information that will help who will manage the contact in the future. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/5GtFmGybR9KyaWkwu69D\_customer-info.png](https://files.readme.io/5GtFmGybR9KyaWkwu69D_customer-info.png)", "customer-info.png", "1276", "886", "\#d54f4a", "" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] During a contact the block button is available in the **Customer actions** section. If the agent wants to block the user, he can simply click on the button **Ban Customer** and a popup with the pre-filled IP address field will appear . The agent can set the Expiration period \(1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month\) and optionally fill the "Notes" field. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/7f3b7c4-Screen\_Shot\_2017-03-27\_at\_11.35.44.png](https://files.readme.io/7f3b7c4-Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_11.35.44.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-03-27 at 11.35.44.png", 1437, 822, "\#d9d9d9" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\]

## Customer history

In this area the agent can find a recap of the previous contacts with the customer he is managing, if they exists. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/itJZ67gTS3c7gcRFZ2eT\_customer-history.png](https://files.readme.io/itJZ67gTS3c7gcRFZ2eT_customer-history.png)", "customer-history.png", "1534", "789", "\#c15657", "" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] The Customer History is divided in 3 areas:

* **contacts overview**, that shows an overview of previous contacts.
* **visits overview**, that shows an overview of previous visits.
* **contact list**, that shows the previous contacts' details. Every row contain the details about every single contact like date, hour, lenght, agent who managed it. 

  By expanding a single contact, it will show the contact's details \(conversation, web lead or other\).

  **Abbreviations**

  Abbreviations, also referred as **shortcuts** are a good way to improve the agent's performance. They reduce the average waiting time for answering to the most frequent questions, only by typing few characters. In this area, the agent can find the list of all shortcuts that he can use.

  \[block:callout\]

  {

  "type": "info",

  "body": "The abbreviations available in the application are configured in the corresponding section reacheable in Settings. It's possible to group different sets of abbreviations based on the tags assigned to them, in order to differentiate them for different groups of agents.   [➡ Read more about \"How to configure the abbreviations\"](doc:abbreviations)"

  }

## Collaboration Tools

Vivocha's collaboration suite has been enriched with new tools and enhancements. A full description of how agents can use them depending of the situation and adapt to the customer's browser capabilities or for any particular privacy need, is available in the [**Collaboration Tools**](doc:collaboration-tools) guide \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/01c1ea9-Screen\_Shot\_2017-03-27\_at\_18.33.30.png](https://files.readme.io/01c1ea9-Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_18.33.30.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-03-27 at 18.33.30.png", 1367, 772, "\#edebe5" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\]

## Contact transfer

Contact transfer is an application that allows the agent to transfer the contact he is managing to another agent or group of agents, if the customer needs another kind of support.

For using it the agent has only to choose the agent or a group of agents to which transfer it and, if he wants, write a short message to give them a help.
