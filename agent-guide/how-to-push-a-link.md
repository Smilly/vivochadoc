# How to push a link

Sometime an agent needs to send a specific link to the customer and/or redirect him to a specific page of the website. Because of this he can send the link in two ways.

1. First way by simply write the address of the link they want to send and sending it to the customer. By clicking on the link the customer will be redirect to the link the agent sent.
2. Second way is a way to create a special kind of link that allows the agent to redirect the customer to the page he linked him. With the mouse on the link just sent, the agent'll see the hint "Click to send immediately" which is the second way to send a link. By clicking on the link the customer will be redirect to the link the agent sent, as before. But if is the agent that clicks this link, the customer will be redirect to the link without to any action. \[block:callout\] { "type": "warning", "body": "Please note that the **page push functionality** works only if you send a page in the same domain of the user location." } \[/block\]
