# Agent Console Interface

To log in on Vivocha, type into the address area of the browser the link received with the access keys from the administrator \(user and password\). The link will be similar to this: **www.vivocha.com/a/**_**ACCOUNT-ID**_**/login**. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/5d5b1c7-vivocha-login.png](https://files.readme.io/5d5b1c7-vivocha-login.png)", "vivocha-login.png", 1418, 791, "\#d6d5d6" \], "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] The main page of your Vivocha account is the **Vivocha Console**. The Vivocha Console is a web application designed to assist Vivocha agents in engaging with online customers, and gives immediate access to all the information and tools needed by an agent to be as productive and effective as possible.

After the log in, the **console** will be displayed to the agent. It is divided into **three macro areas**:

* [the top bar](agent-console-interface.md#section-the-top-bar);
* [the right section](agent-console-interface.md#section-the-right-section);
* [the left-center section](agent-console-interface.md#section-the-left-center-section).

  **The top bar**

The dark grey **top bar** shows:

* the [Settings](doc:agent-settings) button: to modify your account information;
* a [realtime overview](agent-console-interface.md#section-realtime-overview) of what is happening on the site;
* the available [Medias](agent-console-interface.md#section-media-switches) \(chat, video, voice etc.\) for the agent and their status \(ON/OFF\);
* the [pause/play button](agent-console-interface.md#section-status-notifier) and the related label that specify the agent status;
* the [agent menu](agent-console-interface.md#section-agent-menu). \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/najQrFDhRbGjVUBgpAbj\_tobbar.png](https://files.readme.io/najQrFDhRbGjVUBgpAbj_tobbar.png)", "tobbar.png", "1278", "890", "\#ca7e5b", "" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] Here he can also know:
* the maximum **number of contact** he can handle by chat;
* his available medias;
* his selected role;
* his selected language;
* his ID;
* his personal info \(first and last name, e-mail and nickname\);
* which tags are attributed to him.

### Realtime Overview

\[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/wjoqQU0ATTSlr1AhNQSh\_realtime-topbar.png](https://files.readme.io/wjoqQU0ATTSlr1AhNQSh_realtime-topbar.png)", "realtime-topbar.png", "574", "197", "\#1d546c", "" \] } \] } \[/block\] 1. Current number of visitors in your website. 2. Amounts of engagement widgets on your site that are currently been viewed by visitors. 3. Number of agents currently available in your group. 4. Amounts of visitors that agents are talking to \(contacts managed\).

### Chat, voice and video switches.

They consisted of a pause/start button, up to three individual switches for chat, voice and video channels that change according to the agent's availability on the console.

### Pause button and Status Notifier

A circular button with a pause/play symbol allows to enter/exit from the pause state: by clicking it the current status of the available media channels change at once. \[block:callout\] { "type": "info", "body": "More information about how agents can use the media switches and pause button to handle contacts are provided at the [How to use Media Switches](doc:media-switches-all) page", "title": "Info" } \[/block\]

### Agent Menu

By clicking the user-menu on the right, you can see the _Agent menu_. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/ba09779-agent\_menu\_1.png](https://files.readme.io/ba09779-agent_menu_1.png)", "agent\_menù\_1.png", 546, 552, "\#1f546c" \] } \] } \[/block\] 1. The first row contains: your name, your e-mail and your phone number. 2. **Show contacts when paused**: if active, this option allows the system to show to the agent and, if he wants, to handle incoming contacts though he is paused. In this case the system disregards the paused agent in the global count of loading percentage, but it will show him incoming contacts. 3. **Automatic spellcheck**: if active, this option, useful for chat contacts, allows the system to correct typing errors committed by the agent during a contact with the customer. 4. **Audio notifications**: if active, this option allows the system to send to the agent audio notifications contextually to his activity. 5. **Console notifications**: if active, this option allows the system to send notifications to the agent through the browser. 6. A link to redirect the the agent to this Documentation 7. By clicking this button the agent will be logged out. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/dc4214e-agent\_menu.gif](https://files.readme.io/dc4214e-agent_menu.gif)", "agent\_menù.gif", 1279, 923, "\#edecec" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\]

## The right section

The section on the right contains the "waiting contacts" area where all the incoming contacts are displayed and the "assigned contacts" area which contain the contacts that in that moment are managed by the agent. \[block:callout\] { "type": "info", "title": "Info", "body": "For more detailed descriptions about how the agents can take advantage of all the available functionalities offered by Vivocha to interact with the customer please look at the following pages:\n\n[How to handle a contact](doc:how-to-handle-a-contact)\n[How to handle a chat](doc:how-to-handle-a-chat)\n[How to send a file](doc:how-to-send-a-file)\n[How to push a link](doc:how-to-push-a-link)\n[How to handle a video chat](doc:how-to-handle-a-video-chat)\n[How to handle a Call Back](doc:how-to-handle-a-call-back-now)\n[How to handle an inbound call](doc:inbound-call)\n[How to handle an outbound call](doc:outbound-call)" } \[/block\]

## The left-center section

Once an agent have successfully logged in and every time he is not involved in the handling of contacts, the majority of the screen is made up of a real time monitor that shows the activities on the website such as the amount of visitors, widgets and contacts and the agent’s personal performances. \[block:callout\] { "type": "info", "title": "Info", "body": "For a more detailed description of these tools please read [Realtime Tools](doc:realtime-tools)" } \[/block\]

\[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/bd7ce88-agent\_console2.png](https://files.readme.io/bd7ce88-agent_console2.png)", "agent\_console2.png", 1357, 803, "\#646463" \], "caption": "" } \] } \[/block\] When the agent accept a contact this area will modify its layout to hide the real time stats and show, in the left side, the **Console application list** that he can use to manage his contacts. The below picture shows the Customer info application which is the default one that appears when a contact is accepted. \[block:callout\] { "type": "info", "title": "Info", "body": "An in depth description for these other applications and tools available in the platform can be found at the following pages:\n[Console Applications](doc:console-applications)\n[How to transfer a contact](doc:how-to-transfer-a-contact)" } \[/block\]
