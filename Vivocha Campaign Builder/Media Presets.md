The Media Presets section allows to create new type of presets in addition the the built-in ones, so they can be used by setting up possible interaction modes of the engagement widgets.

[âž¡ Read about the "Interaction modes" in our documentation](doc:vcb-web-engagement-widgets#section--proposed-media-)

The panel shows the list of presets supported by default: **chat, voice, video, sms** and **weblead**. The built-in media presets cannot be modified.

Custom presets meet the need to change the standard functioning of a built-in media to be used in a particular scenario. A custom preset can also groups more media and each of them can be set up changing its configuration parameters.

For example you may want a preset that along with the standard chat and the sharing channels that enables to the use of the sharing tools, during contacts presents a WebRTC voice session working in a bi-directional way but the WebRTC video session is in mono-directional with only the user able to visualize the agent

the necessary steps to configure such custom preset are here described:

1. Select and add the **Chat** media by enabling it both in Transmission and Reception
