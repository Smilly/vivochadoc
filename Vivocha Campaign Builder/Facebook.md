Facebook represents a further channel that it's possible to support into a campaign. As well as from the website, it allows the agents in a call center to be contacted also by customers or the visitors of the facebook page of the company, providing them the chance to send a message through Messenger application.

At the same time agents will see the sent messages in the form of a contact appearing on their Agent Desktop, just as if it would been requested from a web engagement widget or from a different channel supported in the campaign

In the Vivocha platform a Facebook page represents a single entry point for the Facebook Channel. It's possible to set as many entry points as many are the facebook pages from where  you want the visitors may contact the agents, simply sending a message thanks to our integration with the Facebook Messenger platform.

To add a new facebook page click on the **Add new** button in the main card. It will opens the General section to set main settings. It's also possible to disable all the entry points in the channel selecting the checkbox field.
