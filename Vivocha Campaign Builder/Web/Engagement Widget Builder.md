Under the tab named **Preview**, as already said, there are series of configuration parameters related to the specific widget. So for example, in case of the default sidetab is given the possibility to modify properties like the color and position within the page(vertical and horizontal).

If you prefer the widget to appear inside a specific html element of the page you can also indicate the corresponding **CSS selector**

      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}

Once that one or more changes of the settings parameters are carried out, you can apply them by clicking  **Apply Changes** in order you can immediately verify the "look and feel" and how they work, directly in the wide top-center section of the Widget Builder. 

It is also possible verified the **responsiveness** of the widget and its behaviour on devices with different viewports by simply resizing this window.

To make them public and available in the Campaign click the **Save Changes** button.

The figure below shows how it's possible to change the default primary color of the Sidetab and its result on the webpage.

The configuration parameters available to carry out changes are different from the Sitetab's ones. They are those declared at the time this specific type of engagement widget was created by defining its main properties.

The Widget Builder allow to modify the Vivocha Popup on the base of how it was defined. So it is possible to modify the primary color and select a *dark* or a *light* theme, decide whether to make appear a Company logo and eventually load a new one, as well as change the predefined image.
