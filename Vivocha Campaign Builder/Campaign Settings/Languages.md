Even if the campaign is able to support all the added languages, it still keeps to use the default one until a **[Language Detection Strategy](doc:vcb-web-entry-points#section--languages-)** is not defined. This can be set when you are configuring an **Entry Point**.

A language detection strategy determines which is the correct language to use depending on the entry point of the contacts and how it must be detected.
