A just created new Campaign is activated with only the Chat media but you can decide to enable also the Voice and the Video and specify who is enabled to use them: a Voice/Video call can be requested only from the visitor or agent, or both of them.

In case voice and/or video are disabled because must not be initially displayed in the widget, you can still indicate who is enabled to request the media upgrade during an on-going contact.

You could configure the WebLead so that it appears as option during the engagement phase, when there aren't agents online in the Vivocha Console to communicate with your customers, or in case of errors or technical problems.

You can select the data collection you want to associate with, among the ones configured in the library. The user will be asked to fill the fields configured in this form/dialog data collection, for example to leave a message specifying the reason behind the request and the needed info to be re-contacted.

You can set an email address so that it will receive the form filled out by the users. If you don't fill out this field the emails will be sent to the account owner's email.
