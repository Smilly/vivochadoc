The web is one of the possible Channel that a Campaign can support to give the opportunity to users visiting one or more websites, from a desktop browser or navigating on a mobile device, to contact the agents of the call center and ask them for the needed support.

The Campaign Builder provides the necessary tools to implement the business logic and to define how and when the Campaign have to act on the web Channel to achieve its goal.

That means for example to configure:
-  on which websites or pages a Widget should appear.
-  the proactivity rules defining the conditions that must occur to show the Widget 
- the detection strategies for the supported languages, in order the Widgets are displayed with the correct strings to customers from different countries
- the data collection and survey forms to associate, if preliminary data are required and/or a user's rating of the service at the end of each contact.
- The look and field of the Widget and the way it is integrated within the website elements.

By clicking on WEB in the Channel section of the Navigation Menu, it expands showing further 4 elements, each one gives the access to different levels of configuration for the Channel.
