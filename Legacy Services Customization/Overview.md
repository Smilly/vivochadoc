#Step 3:
In Step 3 you will be able to add rules for your engagement service. There are various rules that can be used, for example activating the service only during a specific timeframe (e.g. 9am-9pm) or only after the person has been on the site for a certain amount of time. To add a new rule click on the type or rule you want to add, you will then be asked to define all of the details you want for the rule. If you want to add more than one rule you will have to click on the "Add a new Rule" button to the left of the list of rules after creating a new rule to go back to the list. All of the different rules are explained in more detail on our Engagement Rules page.

#Step 4:
In the first part of Step 4 you will be given the activation code that needs to be copied and pasted into the HTML script of your website. The widget placeholder will also need to be placed into the HTML script, it is what will activate the service on your website, remember to paste it into every page that you want the service to be activated on. The recheck rules section simply states how often the system will check for agent availability for the visitor on your site.

one. You can also insert a tag for the service which can be used to attach a service to a specific agent and also to make it easier to find among a list of many different services. The websites section is used to specify on which pages the service should be activated, if you add a website page the service will be activated only on that page and no other pages connected to the website. The last section of Step 4 is A/B testing group, this can be used with two or more services to test which of the services has the best results.
