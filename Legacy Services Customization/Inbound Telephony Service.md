title: "Inbound Telephony Service"
excerpt: ""
---
Inbound services provides support to your customers by phone. The number can be provided according to the customer language. For example, for one customer care service, we can configure two phone numbers:
- one for the English language
- one for the Italian language

In this way we can configure, for each number, a different welcome message and different on-hold music.

When you click on **New service** you will be given the choice between different types of services. Click on the Inbound button (the phone icon) and you will be directed to the General Inbound service page.

##Routes
The Inbound Service is based on the phone numbers that you set in the Routes section.
In each route you can set:
* a welcome message, which is played when Vivocha answers a phone call
* a waiting music, which is played by Vivocha while the customer is waiting to be connected to an agent

To add a new number you have to click on **Add new route**
