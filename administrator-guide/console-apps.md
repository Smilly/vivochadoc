## Customer info

In this area there are the **main informations about the customer** you are managing, which allow the agent to provide the best support possible. During the first contact with the customer, some of this information will be readily available \(customer geolocation, browser and OS he is using, page from which he started the contact and dates about his current session\).

The remaining informations \(First name, Last name, e-mail and Phone number\) will be available, in whole or in part, if the customer is logged in, or will be collected bt the agent during the contact. By clicking on the center of **Notes** box, the agent can add some information that will help who will manage the contact in the future.

If it is needed, you will also ban the customer preventing him to contact the online customer service again \(this feature is not available for all plans\). \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/5GtFmGybR9KyaWkwu69D\_customer-info.png](https://files.readme.io/5GtFmGybR9KyaWkwu69D_customer-info.png)", "customer-info.png", "1276", "886", "\#d54f4a", "" \] } \] } \[/block\]

## Customer history

In this area the agent can find a recap of the previous contacts with the customer he is managing, if they exists. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/itJZ67gTS3c7gcRFZ2eT\_customer-history.png](https://files.readme.io/itJZ67gTS3c7gcRFZ2eT_customer-history.png)", "customer-history.png", "1534", "789", "\#c15657", "" \] } \] } \[/block\] The Customer History is divided in 3 areas:

* **contacts overview**, that shows an overview of previous contacts.
* **visits overview**, that shows an overview of previous visits.
* **contact list**, that shows the previous contacts' details. Every row contain the details about every single contact like date, hour, lenght, agent who managed it. 

  By expanding a single contact, it will show the contact's details \(conversation, web lead or other\).

  **Shortcuts**

  Shortcuts are a good way to improve the agent's performance. They reduce the average waiting time for answering to the most frequent questions, only by typing few characters. In this area, the agent can find the list of all shortcuts that he can use.

Press :fa-clone: to copy the sentence and have the chance to edit it or press :fa-play: to sent directly the sentence. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/9nGBv2PMT3OgTeydAa0Z\_shortcuts.png](https://files.readme.io/9nGBv2PMT3OgTeydAa0Z_shortcuts.png)", "shortcuts.png", "1279", "891", "\#c47453", "" \] } \] } \[/block\]

## Contact transfer

Contact transfer is a tool that allows the agent to transfer the contact he is managing to another agent or group of agents, if the customer needs another kind of support. For using it the agent has only to choose the agent or group of agents to which transfer it and, if he wants, write a short message to give them a help.
