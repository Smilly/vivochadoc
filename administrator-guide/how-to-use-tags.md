# How to use tags

Tags are a very simple way to organize your your Users, Services, and Shortcuts. They allow your users to have a specified range of responsibility, for example if a user has the tag "a" and a service has the same tag, only the agents with that tag will be able to accept contacts from that service. This will make sure that visitors on your website are sent to the best possible agent for their problem. Likewise, if you tag a shortcut, only users with that tag will be able to use and see that shortcut.

Tags are very easy to set up, simply click on the edit button for the user, service, or shortcut, then enter the tag that you would like in the Tag bar. After it has appeared beneath the bar simply click the close button, the tag will be automatically saved.

Go the the "Users" section and click on the gear symbol for the agent you would like to add a tag to. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/13ad853-Screen\_Shot\_2016-12-08\_at\_16.25.08.png](https://files.readme.io/13ad853-Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_16.25.08.png)", "Screen Shot 2016-12-08 at 16.25.08.png", 1920, 1080, "\#e0e0e0" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] After you are on their personal page you will see the tag bar in the bottom right part of the page. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/a08175c-Screen\_Shot\_2016-12-08\_at\_16.40.20.png](https://files.readme.io/a08175c-Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_16.40.20.png)", "Screen Shot 2016-12-08 at 16.40.20.png", 1541, 855, "\#e2e2e2" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] Type in the tag that you would like to add and hit enter. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/d23dbbf-Screen\_Shot\_2016-12-08\_at\_16.55.46.png](https://files.readme.io/d23dbbf-Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_16.55.46.png)", "Screen Shot 2016-12-08 at 16.55.46.png", 590, 135, "\#e5e5e4" \], "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] After the tag has been added to that agent it will appear below the tag bar. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/afb4cf3-Screen\_Shot\_2016-12-08\_at\_16.54.07.png](https://files.readme.io/afb4cf3-Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_16.54.07.png)", "Screen Shot 2016-12-08 at 16.54.07.png", 573, 131, "\#e4e4e4" \], "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] It will also appear to the right of the agent's name when looking at the "Users" page. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/256b2ad-Screen\_Shot\_2016-12-08\_at\_16.58.05.png](https://files.readme.io/256b2ad-Screen_Shot_2016-12-08_at_16.58.05.png)", "Screen Shot 2016-12-08 at 16.58.05.png", 1253, 82, "\#e5e5e5" \], "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] To add a tag to a service you have to go to the "Services" page and click on the gear symbol for the service you would like to add a tag to. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/8ebb615-Screen\_Shot\_2016-12-09\_at\_16.56.14.png](https://files.readme.io/8ebb615-Screen_Shot_2016-12-09_at_16.56.14.png)", "Screen Shot 2016-12-09 at 16.56.14.png", 1592, 846, "\#e0dfdf" \], "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] Then go to the 4th step of the Web Foundry and you will see a section named "Tags".

\[block:callout\] { "type": "warning", "body": "A tagged service with one or more tags but with no assigned agents will be disabled as if there were no agents online.", "title": "Warning!" } \[/block\] **Example:**

If you have 3 services:

* Service A -&gt; no tag
* Service B -&gt; tag: 'B'
* Service C -&gt; tag: 'C'

and 4 agents:

* agent 1 -&gt; no tag
* agent 2 -&gt; tag: 'B'
* agent 3 -&gt; tag: 'C'
* agent 4 -&gt; tag: 'B' and 'C'

The agent 1 can accept only the contacts from the Service A; The agent 2 can accept the contacts from the Service A and B; The agent 3 can accept the contacts from the Service A and C; The agent 4 can accept all the contacts;

**An agent needs to have all the service's tags in order to accept a contact from that service.**
