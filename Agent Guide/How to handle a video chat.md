In Vivocha a contact is a multimedia interaction: it can take off as a chat to continue as a phone call or video;  the chat channel might be dropped as soon as a phone connection is established, or a video interaction can be launched depending on browser capabilities.

A customer of ours using GoogleChrome web browser enters our website and requests a chat session from a page where a Vivocha widget has been configured. In our agent desktop we are notified the request as appears in the screenshot

The contact card opens up to show us a collection of icons with few states: green circles and blackish and light-grey

When a channel is green with a white icon in the centre, that means it is active; on the other hand when is dark-grey that channel is available and can be activated by clicking on the icon.  A light-grey coloured icon communicates that the channel is not available and cannot be established.

As you can see in the right side of the screenshot, the agent named John has accepted a contact type chat and although he is also enabled for a video contact, now this channel is switched off; it means that the customer cannot request for a video chat with the agent and in fact the corresponding button is not visible to him in the chat widget, as shown in the left side of the image below. On the other hand, the Agent if he wants can activate the media video and engage the customer in a video interaction.

to engage the customer in a video interaction: the agent simply click on the video-camera icon. The interaction proceeds as follow:
* on agent side both voice and video icons turn into orange circles (loading state) and a waiting message appear within the media channel toolbar
* the customer is prompted a video interaction request.
* customer may choose to start a video interaction, showing his local video or to opt in for a voice interaction only, in that case he will see the agent without being seen.

As shown in the image below, an agent can still engage a customer in a video interaction also if he has the media video channel switched off. In fact this only prevent the customer to request a video interaction by hiding the relative button in the chat widget.

If the agent is available on the video channel, the customer can request this type of interaction by clicking on the button with the videocamera icon which appears on the top of the chat widget.

Also in this case the agent is asked to accept the contact.

##How to record a video chat 
Once the Customer or the agent accepts the video request and both the use of the camera and of microphone (depending on browser settings) are allowed, the video interaction starts: all the media icons are green both for agent and customer and now they can see each other and, at the same time, they can see themselves in the small window at the bottom left of the Chat widget (customer) and chat box (agent).

On the media toolbar you may notice three buttons:
* recording button now provides the possibility to record the conversation.
* expand/collapse button to detach the video
* mute button to enable/disable the microphone
