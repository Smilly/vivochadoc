The agents can receive **inbound calls** directly in the Vivocha Console. To receive the Inbound Call, the **Telephony Section** has to be configured and an **Inbound Telephony Service** has to be created from the administrator.

The incoming call will be displayed in the **waiting section**. Clicking on a pending contact, the contact is assigned to the agent and moved in the assigned group.
The distribution of contacts is collaboratively managed by all the agents (pending contacts are shown to all the agents matching the service tags).
