title: "How to send a link and redirect the customer to it"
excerpt: ""
---
Sometime an agent needs to **send a specific link** to the customer and/or **redirect him to a specific page** of the website. Because of this he can send the link in two ways. 

1. First way by simply **write the address** of the link they want to send and sending it to the customer. By clicking on the link the customer will be redirect to the link the agent sent.

2. Second way is a way to create a **special kind of link** that allows the agent to **redirect the customer** to the page he linked him. With the mouse on the link just sent, the agent'll see the hint "Click to send immediately" which is the second way to send a link. By clicking on the link the customer will be redirect to the link the agent sent, as before. But if is the agent that clicks this link, the customer will be redirect to the link without any action.
