##Interaction Area
The box of an assigned contact is composed by different areas with different functionalities.

just below, on the left, you find the icons of the **media channels**  that depending on their states are shown in different colors: green circles, blackish and light grey.

* When a channel is **green with a white icon in the centre**, that means it is active.
* When is **orange with a white icon in the centre**, that means it is connecting. 
* when the icon is **dark-grey** that channel is available and can be activated by clicking on it.  
* A **light-grey** coloured icon communicates that the channel is not available and cannot be established.


On the right you can find a set of tools.

the section in the middle of the chat box (12) is where the exchanged messages are shown, at the bottom (13) is where the agent can type a message.

The agent may use different tools and features during a chat with a customer. 

##Color assigning
For example, at any time the agent may want to assign a color to the chat using the built in  tool.

}
[/block]
##Automatic translations
When a customer interacts with an agent using a foreign language, he can be supported in the translation of the messages exploiting the service offered by **Google Translate** that we have integrated in the platform. By clicking on the flag the translation functionality will be activated; the agent chooses the desired language from the dropdown list and the system automatically tries to translate the messages sent by the customer.

        "#e7e8e8"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

conversely also the agent's response will be translated so the customer can get it in his own idiom.

##How to use abbreviations to send canned responces
The the list of the abbreviations, also called shortcuts, that are available to the agents 
are displayed in the the application of the abbreviation by selecting the &nbsp;:fa-comments-o:&nbsp; icon from the vertical menu on the left.

It’s a widely used functionality by agents that reduces the response time for the frequently asked questions. They can send them in 3 ways: 
- click the play button, 
- click the square button and modify the content before sending 
- type the abbreviation code directly in text field of the chat (e.g. “_wm”).

##Features and Tools
in addition to the capabilities seen so far, agents have access to other tools to be able to better manage customer chat interactions. These are described in depth in the corresponding pages of this documentation

* **[Console Applications](doc:console-applications)**
* **[How to transfer a contact](doc:how-to-transfer-a-contact)**
* **[How to send a file](doc:how-to-send-a-file)**
* **[How to push a link](doc:how-to-push-a-link)**

##Network Connection Problems
Regarding the network connection problem, there are two kinds of errors:

###**Customer side**
when the customer has network connection issues, the agent can send messages correctly to the Vivocha servers but these are not received by the customer. In this case during a chat and near the agent messages, a clock icon will appear which turn into a triangle with yellow background and an exclamation mark (<span style="color:#fc7"> :fa-exclamation-triangle: </span>), to indicate that the messages were not delivered correctly to the customer. 

Possible cause of this problem can be:
* The customer have a network problem;
* The customer is changing the page (page refresh);
* The customer closed the browser;

When the clock icon appears the unsent messages are however received and stored from our servers and, as soon as possible, they will be sent to the user.

        "#dee0da"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
When the messages arrive to the user the clock icon will disappear.

###**Agent side**
when network problems persist for more than a couple of seconds and the agent's console is not able to connect correctly the Vivocha servers your agents will see the **red dot**, on top of Vivocha console near help button, and all the unsent messages (not received from our servers) will be marked with a triangle with red background and an exclamation mark (<span style="color:#dd565a"> :fa-exclamation-triangle: </span>)

        "#efe5e2"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}

When your agents have this issue, it means that their computers/browsers are not able to connect to our servers and, typically, this indicates a network problem in your internal network and, if the agent console stay offline for too much time, all the active contacts will be automatically disconnected.
