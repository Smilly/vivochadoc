For the Co-browsing tool three different approaches are possible, to let you adapt to customer's browser capabilities or to comply to particular privacy needs:

* [Page preview](#section-page-preview)
* [Seamless Co-Browsing](#section-seamless-co-browsing)
* [Form Sharing](#section-form-sharing)

In addition you can also share your entire screen or application with the customers, or ask them to share their screen 

* [Screen casting](#section-screen-casting) 

<br>
##Page preview
It is now available as default functionality to all Vivocha plans. It provides the agent with the capability to follow the customer’s navigation on public/static web pages, and it can now work with non secure pages too (not served by HTTPS protocol).

Now when you try to have a preview of the page visited by the customer, if the page is a non secure one you are asked to choose one of the following solutions:
* Open the link a new window 
* Try to force the HTTPS protocol and open the page inside the Agent Console.

      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
if the page is served by HTTPS protocol the same URL of the contact opens in an iframe inside the Agent Console: this feature provides the possibility to follow the customer as he navigates on the website; it's a link mode that does not allow the agent to have the control of the customer's browser, he is able to see the page but not allowed to interact within it.

    }
  ]
}

##Seamless Co-Browsing 
This functionality allows the agent to see the customer's window through the **follower mode**, and take its remote control using the **presenter mode**. It also provides useful capabilities such as mouse over, annotation tool and page scrolling, to provide the best remote assistance.
Thanks to co-browsing agents will effectively be able to guide visitors to the right page or help them find the right information.

By selecting this option you will be ask to click on the "play" button to start a co-browsing session

the customer is asked to share his browser session.

      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "full"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Once the customer joins the co-browsing session, by default it starts in the **Follower mode** to enable the agent to follow the customer through his website navigation. 

The follower mode is indicated by the symbol :fa-eye: in the switch button. The highlight of specific content is supported so agent can point out some parts of the page. 
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/d6d0204-Screen_Shot_2017-03-29_at_12.30.49.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-29 at 12.30.49.png",
        1440,
        900,
        "#373438"
      ],
      "sizing": "full",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
As the agent highlights some specific content in the page, it appears marked in yellow by a **pencil cursor** also in the customer's screen.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/974ec04-Screen_Shot_2017-03-29_at_12.38.44.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-29 at 12.38.44.png",
        906,
        529,
        "#4d6d8c"
      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "full"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
By clicking on the :fa-eye: button agent can switch to the **Presenter mode** taking the control on the customer's screen to see and interect with the page, making at the same time, the interaction with the page disabled for the customer. The Presenter mode is indicated by the symbol :fa-hand-pointer-o: in the switch button. 
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f77f09c-Screen_Shot_2017-03-30_at_16.00.09.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-30 at 16.00.09.png",

        "#e3e5e7"
      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "original"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The highlight of content is supported also for customer, so this time he can point out some parts of the page and make them highlighted for the agent. In this case the parts are pointed out in **light red** by a pencil cursor which appears both on the customer and agent page.

##Form sharing
This tool allows the agent to help customer in filling forms. the feature has been improved, and it's now possible to select which forms should be displayed to the agent.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/90f6429-Screen_Shot_2017-03-30_at_19.19.00.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-30 at 19.19.00.png",
        1439,
        823,
        "#eaeae9"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Two sharing approaches are now supported:

* Share everything and mark the forms and/or fields you don’t want to share using a special CSS class.
* Share only the forms and fields that are marked for sharing using a special CSS class.

By default all the forms/fields in the page are shared with the agent and no page customisation is needed. The fields marked with the green color can be edited by the agent whereas the ones marked in red are readonly.

A more detailed description about how to configure all these options is available in the section Privacy of the **[Security](doc:security-config#section-privacy)** document of the administrator guide.

        "#eaeaea"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "The Form sharing feature can work only if the forms on the page are standard HTML type (elements <input> and / or <select> within the <form>), already present in the page at the time of loading. If in the HTML of the page the fields of a form are rendered by the execution of javascript and ajax code then these fields are no shown during the session of sharing.",
  "title": "Warning"
}
[/block]
<br>
##Screen casting 
This tool allows both the agent and the customer to stream a specific window, a single app or the full desktop to the other party during any real time interaction.

Screen casting allows the sharing, once for the time, but without any possibility of interaction with the page shared.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "It is available only for Chrome users, through a specific app extension that both the agent and the customer must have installed in their browser. The extension **Vivocha** enables additional features on your Account such as the screen sharing and the screen capturing.",
  "title": "Info"
}
[/block]
To install the **Vivocha** extension follow the steps

1. Open the **[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)**
2. Find and select the extension you want.
3. Click **Add to Chrome**.

  "images": [
    {

        "https://files.readme.io/8830402-Screen_Shot_2017-03-31_at_11.54.21.png",

        "#ececec"
      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "full"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
4. For some extensions, you’ll see a box that lists the data that the extension will be able to access. Click **Add extension** to grant the extension access to your data and install the extension.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f6cf452-Screen_Shot_2017-03-31_at_11.55.13.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-31 at 11.55.13.png",
        468,
        177,
        "#324169"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
An agent can alternatively cast his screen as well as he can request the customer to do the same thing.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a8978b8-Screen_Shot_2017-03-31_at_12.33.11.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-31 at 12.33.11.png",
        707,
        221,
        "#f2efdf"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
In both cases they are asked if they want to share their entire screen, an application window or a Chrome tab. In the image below the example of an agent selecting a PDF document that he wants to share with customer.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4f582b8-Screen_Shot_2017-03-31_at_16.38.32.png",
        "Screen Shot 2017-03-31 at 16.38.32.png",
        619,
        524,
        "#e8e8e8"
      ],
      "sizing": "smart",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Customer can see a minimized preview of the content shared by the agent which is loaded inside the chat widget.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/16ca82c-Schermata_2017-03-31_alle_16.33.38.png",
        "Schermata 2017-03-31 alle 16.33.38.png",
        280,
        641,
        "#e9e6e1"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
He can detach it to expand and have a larger view of the shared content by clicking the :fa-expand: button, minimizing the chat widget. This could be helpful for example when the agent want to highlight some specific parts of a shared document or in general to show something to him.
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/9d27465-Schermata_2017-03-31_alle_16.33.16.png",
        "Schermata 2017-03-31 alle 16.33.16.png",
        1910,
        956,
        "#b6b8b8"
      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "full"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
As we said also the customer could have the need to share his screen with the agent. 
In this case he is asked to accept a screen sharing session
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/6d306d7-Schermata_2017-03-31_alle_16.39.06.png",
        "Schermata 2017-03-31 alle 16.39.06.png",
        280,
        564,
        "#e9e4de"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
and this is how it appears to the agent inside the Vivocha Agent Desktop. 
[block:image]

  "images": [
