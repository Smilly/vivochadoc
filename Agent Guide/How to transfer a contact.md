title: "How to transfer a contact"
excerpt: ""
---
Transferring a contact can be very useful, especially if you have agents that are specialized in a certain subject. This assures that the customers receive the best possible service from the person who knows the most about the question asked.

The agent can access the specific application while he is chatting with a customer by clicking on the  button on the left side of the Console and he will be taken to the page for transfers.

On this page he will have the choice to decide whether he wants to send the contact to a specific agent or to a group of them, which are referred as **Transfer Groups**.
A Transfer Group consists in a set of agents grouped together to simplify the identification of a set of services/tags which describe the skills needed to provide always the most high level of assistance to a customer.

By clicking on the name of the group or the single agent, a popup will appear asking you whether you want to transfer the contact. it's also possible to insert a message to inform the agent that will take the transfer about what exactly the customer needs. After that a message is eventually added by clicking "Yes"  the contact is transferred.

The agent that receives the transfer will receive a contact request in the waiting area of his Vivocha Console, possibly along with a message from the agent who has  transferred it. He simply have to accept the contact to start chatting.

The arrow icon informs the agent that the contact is actually a transfer. After accepting the chat they will have access to the conversation that the contact had with the previous agent. The agent may also have the necessity to skip the request, ignoring it,  by clicking on the Reject button. 

This picture shows what the customer will see during the transfer.

It means that if an agent transfers a contact to you, the time you have to take that contact is the transfer timeout. \n\nA user with the role of administrator can set it for each service on Settings - step 2 of the service customization of the Vivocha Foundry (the default value is 60 seconds). For more details please look at **[How to set the Dissuasion Timeout](doc:how-to-set-the-dissuasion-timeout)** document.",
