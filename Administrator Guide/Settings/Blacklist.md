title: "Blacklist"
excerpt: ""
---
To block unwanted users is achievable in three ways:

* the agent can block the user's IP address directly on the **[Customer Info](doc:console-applications#section-customer-info)** section.
* an administrator/supervisor can block the user's IP address directly on the **[Contact Details Page](doc:ban-ip-contact-detail)** in the Reports section;
* an administrator/supervisor can manage (add, remove and renew the expiration period) the user's IP address on the settings section.
 
From this panel an administrator/supervisor can do this using the third method by viewing and editing the **Blacklist**
