excerpt: ""

In this section a administrator can see the list of all the users set in the account, unlike of the supervisors who can visualize only the ones that share with them the same set of tags or a subset of them.

To find a user within the list you can type the name or the ID in the search field or you can filter by tag. It's also possible to show only the users that are online in that moment.
