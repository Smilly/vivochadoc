title: "How to set the Dissuasion Timeout"
excerpt: ""
---
Dissuasions are messages that are sent to customers that have been waiting for a chat for a predetermined amount of time. It will simply notify the visitor that there is no available agent that can receive the contact.

Dissuasions are important because they let your visitors know that there was no one available instead of making them wait for a long time with no answer.

Dissuasions can be customized in many different ways, you can edit the message that is sent as a dissuasion.

        "#aa253d"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}

you can even make it so that a WebLead appears instead of a message so that the customer can insert their information and be recontacted the next time an agent is available.

The agent can see how long they have left until the customer is dissuaded by looking at the red line around the communication symbol when the visitor is in the waiting section of the Vivocha Console.

Dissuasions are also very useful for Owners, Administrators, and Auditors because if you look in the **[Services](doc:services-report)** section in Reports you can see whether there is a high number of dissuasions and understand whether your agents are answering the contact requests as they should be.
