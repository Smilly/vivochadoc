# Blacklist in the Contact detail page

Occasionally, a customer can repeatedly harass the agents by making use of abusive language without any real intent of using the service. In order to protect the agents against abusive customers and avoid the waste of resources due to other types of misuse, we provide a blacklist functionality that allows you to block customers for a period of time.

The Blacklist feature blocks the user using his current IP address. This action is reversible: an administrator/supervisor can unblock the IP address.

The block is applied for a fixed period of time which is renewable. Those are the possible periods:

* 1 hour
* 1 day
* 1 week
* 1 month

The user will no longer be able to interact with the agents until the end of the selected period.

You can easily block unwanted users in three ways:

* the agent can block the user's IP address directly on the [**Customer Info**](doc:console-applications#section-customer-info) section during the chat itself.
* an administrator/supervisor can block the user's IP address directly on the contact's detail;
* an administrator/supervisor can manage \(add, remove and renew the expiration period\) the user's IP address on the [**Blacklist**](doc:blacklist-config) panel in the Settings section.

  In this document the second method is described:

## **User's IP address blocked by an administrator/supervisor on the contact detail panel**

An administrator/supervisor can block an user using the Contacts Report. From the list of contacts in the report section, choose the contact with the user that you want to block. Next to IP Address there will be the "Ban" button: click on it. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/a5d3956-Screen\_Shot\_2017-03-27\_at\_15.43.23.png](https://files.readme.io/a5d3956-Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_15.43.23.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-03-27 at 15.43.23.png", 1919, 1005, "\#e2e4e2" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] A popup will appear with the pre-filled "IP address" field. The administrator/supervisor can set the Expiration period \(1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month\) and optionally fill the"Notes" field. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/3ddf342-Screen\_Shot\_2017-03-27\_at\_15.51.22.png](https://files.readme.io/3ddf342-Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_15.51.22.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-03-27 at 15.51.22.png", 1432, 930, "\#7d7f7e" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] After that, the IP address will be blocked and it will shown as **Blocked**. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/0f7fa68-Screen\_Shot\_2017-03-27\_at\_15.45.53.png](https://files.readme.io/0f7fa68-Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_15.45.53.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-03-27 at 15.45.53.png", 1920, 1004, "\#e2e4e3" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\]
