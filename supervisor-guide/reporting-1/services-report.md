In the **Services Report** you can see all of the different data collected from your account's services. On your Vivocha Console, click on _Reports_, then on _Services_. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/c6501fd-Screen\_Shot\_2017-02-08\_at\_17.52.05.png](https://files.readme.io/c6501fd-Screen_Shot_2017-02-08_at_17.52.05.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-02-08 at 17.52.05.png", 1018, 583, "\#e0dfdb" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\] As well as for the Overview Page, by clicking the dropdown bars on the top you can access the **Filter Panel** \(for more info see [**Reports Tools**](doc:reports-tools-page#section-filter-panel) document\) and select which data visualize by filtering services, media and tags one by one or, through one of proposed options by choosing among the enabled ones , all or none of them.

You can also determine the desired period, selecting among the last 7, 15 or 30 days. It is also possible to select a customizable period. These periods will vary depending on your subscribed plan for your account. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/c81cf4a-Screen\_Shot\_2017-02-01\_at\_10.41.55.png](https://files.readme.io/c81cf4a-Screen_Shot_2017-02-01_at_10.41.55.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-02-01 at 10.41.55.png", 1364, 384, "\#e9e9e9" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\] By clicking on the submit button the query based on the set conditions is run and the result are the data of the requests/contacts that are shown both in the bar graph on the top than in the detailed views at bottom of the page.

### The Graph

At the top of the Services Report page, data are shown in a bar graph. Above it you can see also which are the selected services, media and tags that produced the chart. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/d2575da-chart\_1.png](https://files.readme.io/d2575da-chart_1.png)", "chart\_1.png", 1877, 548, "\#e7e8e7" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\] The dashboard provides also other options to have different representations of these data:

using the **General/Engage** switch, on the the left top corner of the chart, is possible to display the total number of interactions generated by your services or the engagement rate. The subswitch allow you to select whether to display data by hours or by days. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/80ff557-chart\_2.png](https://files.readme.io/80ff557-chart_2.png)", "chart\_2.png", 1879, 529, "\#e8e8e8" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] Furthermore, by default the data are displayed by a bar chart but if you want you can visualize it in the shape of a area chart just selecting this option on the top right button of the chart itself. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/c4ba202-chart\_3.png](https://files.readme.io/c4ba202-chart_3.png)", "chart\_3.png", 1882, 508, "\#efd791" \] } \] } \[/block\]

### The in-depth views

As well as for the Overview Report, the Services Report page embeds an analog switch which allows to display two different views.

The **Requests** view is the default one and it presents a series of boxes, each showing a specific statistic based on the total number of requests. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/8d6596a-chart\_4.png](https://files.readme.io/8d6596a-chart_4.png)", "chart\_4.png", 1517, 485, "\#e3e3e2" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] The **Details** panel displays all the filtered services separately using an accordion. Each entry is expandable by clicking on it. When collapsed three macro data in percentage are show on the right:

* engagements \(represents the number of engagments in relation to users on the website\)
* successes
* requests \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/5000ff8-chart\_5.png](https://files.readme.io/5000ff8-chart_5.png)", "chart\_5.png", 1172, 420, "\#e1e2e2" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] By clicking on the service you'll access a in-depth outlook on that service with specific statistics, with both the percentage and the total number:
* **successes:** represents the contacts that were successful \(sent at least 3 bidirectional messages if it's a chat\);
* **dissuasions:** represents the contacts that were not engaged by agents.
* **abandoned:** represents the contacts started and left by the customers after waiting at least 10 seconds;
* **cancellations:** represents the contacts started and closed by customers before 10 seconds had passed;
* **no interaction:**  represents the contacts with less than 3 messages\)
* **failed:** represents the contacts that can't be characterized as successful, abandoned, cancelled, no\_interaction or dissuaded. That may happen due to technical problems: network errors, page closed before the client software send the event, browser crashes, etcsually contacts with errors\)
* **requests:** represents the number of requested contacts for the specified service;
* **pageview:** represents the number of pages viewed by your customers;
