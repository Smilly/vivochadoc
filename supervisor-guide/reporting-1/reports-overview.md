# Reports Overview

The **Reports Overview** is the first page of the Reports Section. It has all of the basic data collected from your Vivocha account.

On your Vivocha Console, click on _Reports_ and you will find yourself automatically on the Overview page: \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/594549e-reports\_overview.png](https://files.readme.io/594549e-reports_overview.png)", "reports overview.png", 1919, 1005, "\#dedfdf" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\]

## The Bar Chart

The data will change based on which services and media you have selected in the **Filter Panel** \(for more info see [**Reports Tools**](doc:reports-tools-page#section-filter-panel) document\) that you can access by clicking in the dropdown bars on the top.. You can also select a date against which compare data shown in the charts. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/fd16a2b-drop-down\_bar\_overview.png](https://files.readme.io/fd16a2b-drop-down_bar_overview.png)", "drop-down bar overview.png", 1159, 346, "\#eaeaea" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\] At the top of the page a bar graph displays the values of the requests, that are all the contacts of the day, in the range of time selected, where each bar represents one of the possible outcomes.

the yellow bars represent the values of the successful requests, while the others indicate requests which were finalized with a different outcome.

the bars in light grey indicate the successful requests of the day selected in the drop-down bar on the top of the chart. By default it is set on the day before.

Thanks to a **period switch** you can display the chart based on a different time span:

* 1 hour
* 3 hours
* all \(from midnight till now\)

You can also zoom further on parts of the data by acting on the **horizonatal scroll bar** at the bottom of the chart. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/43c2472-top\_chart\_bar\_overview.png](https://files.readme.io/43c2472-top_chart_bar_overview.png)", "top chart bar overview.png", 1374, 397, "\#e1e0d9" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\] The bottom of the Overview Report page embeds a **Requests/Agents switch** which allows to display two different views: **Requests** and **Agents**

## The Requests Tab

The default view \(**Requests tab**\) displays several boxes, each of them includes some specific data values that are considered useful for monitoring. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/9592f1b-requests\_tab.png](https://files.readme.io/9592f1b-requests_tab.png)", "requests tab.png", 1253, 500, "\#e2e2e2" \], "sizing": "full", "border": true } \] } \[/block\] These boxes show the percentages on the total number of requests for each of the possible outcomes, for:

* **Successful**
* **Dissuasions**
* **Abandoned**
* **Canceled**
* **No interaction** \(less than 3 messages\)
* **Unfinalized** \(interaction with errors\)

\[block:callout\] { "type": "info", "body": "to understand the meaning of each of the possible outcomes that is attributed to contacts, see the document [Contacts](doc:contacts-report) in Reports section", "title": "Info" } \[/block\] In addition there are other five boxes display values for other data that are measured:

* **Visits**
* **Pageviews**
* **Widgets**
* **average interaction times**
* **average answer time**

for each box three or four values and a time range are displayed:

* the bigger number is the current relative or absolute value on the given time range
* yesterday's value on the same time range
* today's value
* parentheses: the difference between yesterday and today

## The Agents Tab

The second view that you can access clicking on the switch is the Agents one. In this view each box represents an agent and his performance in the selected period, with info about:

* **availability**, the amount of time in which he is logged in the Console
* **successful**, indicating the total number of successful contact he has handled.
* **response**, that is the average time of response
* **interaction**, which is the average time of interaction

  At the top right corner of this view, beside the total amount of successful contacts among all the agents, another switch allows to display the same data within a list.
