## The Graph

In this report data of requests/contacts are shown and aggregated according to the selected agents/tags in the Filter Panel that are visible in the graph above the switches and the bars.

The default view displays three different categories of contacts represented in two bars:

* **success:**
* **joined:**
* **received:**

  \[block:image\]

    "#e7e8e7"
  ],
  "sizing": "full",
  "border": true
  ```

    }

  \]

  }

  \[/block\]

  You can then display them grouped **By Day** or **By Hour**.

In the other available views the bars in the graph represent the **Interaction Average Time** and the **Average Answer Time**. Moreover, instead of the average "By Day" or "By Hour", these values can be grouped also **By Slot**.

Also, acting on the **Bar/Area chart switch** data can displayed in a different type of graph.

The images below show some possibilities of displaying data provided by the dashboard:

the average interaction time of contacts displayed by hour. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/87ae3de-Screen\_Shot\_2017-02-14\_at\_11.40.38.png](https://files.readme.io/87ae3de-Screen_Shot_2017-02-14_at_11.40.38.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-02-14 at 11.40.38.png", 1396, 285, "\#f0c974" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] The average answer time of contacts during the defined slots of time. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/c2dd65e-Screen\_Shot\_2017-02-14\_at\_11.40.58.png](https://files.readme.io/c2dd65e-Screen_Shot_2017-02-14_at_11.40.58.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-02-14 at 11.40.58.png", 1390, 277, "\#637b8b" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] The joined contacts, those received and the successes, displayed by day in a Area chart. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/6a1d3db-Screen\_Shot\_2017-02-14\_at\_11.41.57.png](https://files.readme.io/6a1d3db-Screen_Shot_2017-02-14_at_11.41.57.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-02-14 at 11.41.57.png", 1371, 288, "\#d8c285" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] the same statistics are also reported inside the boxes below the graph: \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/1f8713f-Screen\_Shot\_2017-02-14\_at\_15.06.50.png](https://files.readme.io/1f8713f-Screen_Shot_2017-02-14_at_15.06.50.png)", "Screen Shot 2017-02-14 at 15.06.50.png", 1127, 113, "\#e3e3e3" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\]
