### Auditor

At the base of the hierarchical pyramid there is the **auditor**, also called _analyst_, whose role is to **analyze reports** containing all the dates about agents performance and services.

### Agent

Just above the auditor we can find the **agent**, role who has the task of managing incoming contacts. The agent powers allow him only to **manage** and **transfer contacts**, as well as **analyze his performance**.

### Supervisor

The supervisor has the role of monitoring the activities and performances of the call center. If he wants or he need it, he can also manage the contacts as a normal agent. The supervisor can add or remove applications too, but he can't create services. He has the faculty of **add new agents** or **remove the already existing**.

### Administrator

The Admin\*\* is the role with the maximum power: he can do everything all the other roles can do and in addiction he can create or remove services
