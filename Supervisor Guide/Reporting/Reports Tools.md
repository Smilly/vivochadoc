This section introduces you to a bunch of new features implemented from version 4.2
 
##Filter Panel
The filter panel is a very useful and important part of the reports section: it's the tool you use to customize the displayed data through precise filtering and comparing options.

You can access the panel **by clicking on the page title (down arrow).**

The filter panel is available **in each of the reports sections**: it consists of a drop-down module divided by vertical columns, each  of which correspond to  a list such as services, tags, media, agents etc. You can include/exclude any item  of a list by clicking on it.

Once you've decided the entries you want to include in the reports, click on the submit button to push your configuration and output the desired combination of charts and data.

You can use the **ENABLED | ALL | NONE**  switch to include/exclude all the entries of a category at once.

as an example, the filter panel in the image below is the one that you can see in the Services Reports page.
