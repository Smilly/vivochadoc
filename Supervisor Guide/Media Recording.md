One of the new features introduced with this new version of Vivocha is the **Media recording**, that is the ability given to an agent to record the video or the voice call with the customer. To do that he simply needs to click the record button then select the media he wants to record: only voice or both voice and video.

After doing this the recording starts.

To stop the recording you simply click the button again. Once stopped two files are produced: 
one corresponding to what was recorded by the agent's camera and the other one corresponding to that recorded by the customer's camera.

These two files are made available to a supervisor in the **silent monitoring area** where he can monitor a contact which is still in progress. 
The files can be played simultaneously to reproduce the recording, you can also enable/disable the audio on single or both sides, and it is also possible to dowloaded each of them separately.

The ability to reproduce the recording and download the single files is also given in the contact transcript that you can find in the report area. 

Once there's no need to continue with a video/voice interaction, both customer and agent may return to a chat-only contact by clicking the green video/voice icon. Doing this they interrupt their video/voice call returning to the previous state.
