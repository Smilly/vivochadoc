Vivocha includes a reporting module to give its users insight on the performance and effectiveness of each active Vivocha service.

Reports measure the performance of the contact center, recording typical **Key Performance Indicators**, such as:

* Number of chats, voice, video, callbacks (per agent, group and service);
* Average duration of contacts;
* Number and temporal distribution of contacts;
* Number of missed contacts (abandoned and cancelled);
* Average waiting time;
* Average interaction time.

As said in the Reports Section we have different types of reports:

* **[Reports Overview](doc:report-overview-page)**
* **[Service Reports](doc:services-report)**
* **[Agent Reports](doc:agents-report)**
* **[Contact Reports](doc:contacts-report)**

Each of these reports can be produced by setting different parameters using tools that allow to customize the displayed data through precise filtering and comparing options.

* **[Reports Tools](doc:reports-tools-page)**
