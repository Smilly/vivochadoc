# AB testing

Using A/B testing you can test the performance of two or more services from the same group. Only one of the services belonging to the specified group will be displayed to the user for the duration of the visit.

When the A/B testing functionality is active a user will see one service inside the group, the shown service will be chosen randomly and this user will see the same service until the A/B group will not be changed. \[block:callout\] { "type": "warning", "body": "A service can be assigned to only one A/B testing at time" } \[/block\]

## Configuration

Configure the A/B testing group is very easy, you simple need to create or edit a service, go on the 4th step of service configuration and add a group name.

Please remember that all the services that you want test need to have the same group name. \[block:image\] { "images": \[ { "image": \[ "[https://files.readme.io/9cf8e1c-Schermata\_2013-02-05\_alle\_16.22.47.png](https://files.readme.io/9cf8e1c-Schermata_2013-02-05_alle_16.22.47.png)", "Schermata 2013-02-05 alle 16.22.47.png", 1024, 673, "\#e5e5e3" \], "border": true, "sizing": "full" } \] } \[/block\] To remove one service from a one A/B group you can simple disable it from your dashboard or delete the group name from this 4th step of service configuration.

## Services section

In your services section the A/B group are visually grouped by color, so you can easily find all the service in the same test group.
